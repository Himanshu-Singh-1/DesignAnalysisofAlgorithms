## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Project has implementation of 4 sorting algorithms: Exchange, Merge, Insertion and Quick sort.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## FILES INCLUDED:
1.singh_prog1.c:
	Contains Implementation of following sorting algorithms:
	1. Exchange Sort 
	2. Insertion Sort 
	3. Merge Sort 
	4. Quick Sort 
after running select any of the algorithm and give the input size, i.e the number of numbers to be sorted. Random numbers between 1 to 20 are generated and sorted. Each step of the algorithm is depicted by printing stars which depicts the partially sorted array.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## COMPILING CODE:
gcc -g singh_prog1.c -lm -o singh_prog1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## RUNNING CODE:
1. Enter choice 1 to 4 all other values will result in termination of program.
2. Enter the size of array should be between 1 and 1000 or program will exit.
3. Output of sorting algorithms is printed to the console.
